I am a post-doctoral fellow under the supervision of Jakob Ruess in the team Lifeware at INRIA Saclay.

My main research interests are probability theory and its application to biology. Concerning mathematical analysis, I focus on studying stochastic processes (such as structured population dynamics or multiscale process) from a probability perspective, for example proving limit theorems or extinction times. I am also interested in numerical simulations of these processes in order to estimate parameters of dynamic models. The biological applications I am working on are cell populations, evolutionary biology and gene expression.
